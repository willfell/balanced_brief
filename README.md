# The Balanced Brief

This is a side project created to make ingesting news in the morning a little more quickly and a little more balanced. 

I created this utilizing Reddit's API alongside OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

Here is the execution flow

1. Scan the top posts of the day from a multitude of subreddits
2. Gather the image/article content 
3. Have GPT summarize it in a hundred words or less. 
4. Send that shit
