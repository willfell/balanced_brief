# The Balance Brief

This is a side project created to make ingesting news in the morning a little more quickly and a little more balanced. 

I created this utilizing Reddit's API alongside OpenAI's ChatGPT4. 

Here is the execution flow

1. Scan the top posts of the day from a multitude of subreddits
2. Gather the image/article content 
3. Have GPT 4 summarize it in a hundred words or less. 

Right now it is functioning but there are still a ton more to do before I can slowly start roling this out/be happy with it. Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions, or would like to a user in the userlist. 

### To Do List

- [ ] Create a signup page, where the user gets to check what categories of news that they want. 
- [ ] Order the news by broader category, an example being
    - Sports
        - Hockey
        - Baseball
        - Football
    - News
        - General News
        - Conservative News
        - Liberal News
- [ ] Backend tracking of all emails sent
- [ ] More efficient use of the backend code and database
- [ ] Standardizing the email metadata - making it more professional
