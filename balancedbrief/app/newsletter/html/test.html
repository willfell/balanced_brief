                    <h2>Rocket Misfire Likely Cause of Deadly Gaza Hospital Blast, Human Rights Watch Says</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) has stated that evidence suggests a misfired rocket was the likely cause of
                    an explosion at a hospital in Gaza on October 17th. The explosion, which resulted in heavy
                    casualties, triggered outrage across the Arab world. Palestinians blamed an Israeli air strike,
                    while Israel said it was caused by a misfiring Palestinian rocket launch. HRW conducted an
                    investigation into the incident and based its findings on a review of photos and videos, satellite
                    imagery, and interviews with witnesses and experts.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Javier Milei, a libertarian firebrand, has won the runoff election in Argentina and will become the
                    country's next president. Milei's campaign focused on drastic changes to the struggling economy,
                    including cuts to public spending and pegging the economy to the US dollar. He plans to sell
                    government-run companies and implement tax cuts and spending cuts. Milei's administration will have
                    a limited government, respect for private property, and free trade. He aims to solve the country's
                    economic issues by canceling debt and dollarizing the economy. Milei will face challenges in
                    Congress, but may use Decrees of Necessity and Urgency to pass bills. He plans to reduce the number
                    of government ministries and has announced potential cabinet appointments.</p>

                    guidelines and will not contain explicit sexual content.</p>

                <p>The author recounts a story about a programmer named Tim who had a consistently low productivity
                    score of zero. However, the author fought to keep Tim on the team because, instead of working on
                    individual tasks, Tim spent his time pairing with teammates and helping them learn and improve. This
                    made the entire team more effective and productive. The author argues that measuring individual
                    productivity in a complex system is flawed and instead suggests measuring tangible business impact
                    or proxy business metrics.</p>

                    Messages retains the gain map data, allowing the images to be viewed as Ultra HDR in Google Photos.

                <p>Australia's competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), has
                    called for new competition laws to be implemented in response to the rapid expansion of digital
                    platforms such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft in the country. The ACCC has raised
                    concerns about the potential for anti-competitive behavior by these platforms, including invasive
                    data collection and practices that limit customer choice and deter innovation at competitors. The
                    ACCC has proposed targeted consumer protections and service-specific codes to prevent such behavior.

                </div>
                <p>Pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) is a fatty acid that has been shown to have various health benefits,
                    including protecting heart, immune, and liver health. It activates AMPK and inhibits mTOR, which are
                    important components of the human longevity pathway. In a study comparing C15:0 with three other
                    compounds known to enhance longevity, C15:0 and rapamycin showed the most clinically relevant
                    activities. They shared several beneficial effects, including anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and
                    anticancer activities. These findings support the idea that C15:0 is an essential nutrient with
                    similar or even greater health benefits than other longevity-enhancing compounds.</p>

                <p>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has the potential to revolutionize scientific research,

                    efforts, interdisciplinary research, and responsible practices. The responsible integration of
                    superintelligent systems into society will require addressing these challenges.</p>

                    Israel. The students ran through the hallways, waved Palestinian flags, and attempted to enter the
                    teacher's classroom. The incident is being investigated by the NYPD's counterterrorism bureau.</p>

                <p>Indiana University has fired football coach Tom Allen after the team completed its third consecutive
                    losing season. Allen, who had been with the team since 2017, finished with a record of 33-49 as head
                    coach. The decision comes after Indiana dropped its final three games of the season, finishing with
                    a 3-9 record. Athletic director Scott Dolson cited a loss of momentum as the reason for the change
                    in leadership. Allen will receive a $15.5 million settlement from the school, paid over two
                    installments.</p>

                    for performers to request an intimacy coordinator on set, as well as protections against
                    retaliation. Intimacy coordinators are professionals who help actors navigate scenes involving

                    step towards ensuring the well-being of actors on set.</p>
